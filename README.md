## Creating an environment

### Provisioning an instance

For Microsoft FTEs, provision a [Dynamics 365 Enterprise P1 Trial Instance](https://www.cwcwiki.com/wiki/Dynamics_for_CSE_Engagements#Trial_Instances) (Microsoft internal link).

Take note of the instance URL, admin username and password. Configure the password as a GitHub repository secret named `PASSWORD`.

### Deploying the solution

Adapt the values under `env` in [deploy.yaml](`.github/workflowsdeploy.yaml`) to your environment. From the GitHub Actions tab, run the `Deploy solution` workflow.

This sets up the solution based on the assets in the `src` directory, and populates data using the Postman collection in the `data` directory.

### Exporting the solution

After performing manual changes to the solution in Power Apps, run the `Export solution` workflow from the GitHub Actions tab to prepare a pull request to update the solution files in the  `src` folder on the `main` branch.

Check the run logs for the name of the created branch:

```
Run microsoft/powerplatform-actions/branch-solution@0.4.0
create-solution-pr:
... prepare staging branch
... stage solution into branch src-20220518-2113
... commit solution into src-20220518-2113 and push to https://github.com/OneWeekBreathe/Breathe
```

Create a pull request from that branch.

## Using Postman

[Set up your Postman environment for Dataverse](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-apps/developer/data-platform/webapi/setup-postman-environment).

Import the environment and collections in the `data` folder.

To support automation using `newman`, we have added an extra `token` environment variable containing the OAuth2 token.

In Postman, under the collection's Authorization tab, click `Get New Access Token`, `Proceed` and copy the token value into an environment variable named `token`.
